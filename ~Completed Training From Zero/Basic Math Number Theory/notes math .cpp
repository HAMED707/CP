 the number 5 is a prime number, and it is coprime with 1, 2, 3, and 4. Two numbers are considered coprime if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1. Here's a quick breakdown:

     gcd(5, 1) = 1
     gcd(5, 2) = 1
     gcd(5, 3) = 1
     gcd(5, 4) = 1
     Since all the gcd values are 1, 5 is coprime with each of these numbers.
